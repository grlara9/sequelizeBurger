# sequelizeBurger
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and using Sequelize.js. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once the user is done ordering a burger, the app allows you to "Devour" the burger and then sends the burger to the devoured side of the page.

## How it works ##

-Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
-Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to -the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
